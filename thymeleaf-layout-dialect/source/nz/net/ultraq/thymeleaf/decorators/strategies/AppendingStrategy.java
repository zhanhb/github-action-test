/**
 * The standard {@code <head>} merging strategy, which simply appends the
 * content elements to the layout ones.
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour of the layout dialect has historically been to place
 * the {@code <title>} element at the beginning of the {@code <head>} element
 * during the decoration process; an arbitrary design decision which made
 * development of this library easier. However, this runs against the
 * expectations of developers who wished to control the order of elements, most
 * notably the position of a {@code <meta charset...>} element.
 * <p>
 * This sorting strategy has been updated in 2.4.0 to retain this behaviour as
 * backwards compatibility with the 2.x versions of the layout dialect, but is
 * now deprecated and expected to be replaced by the
 * {@link AppendingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy} sorter from version 3.x onwards.
