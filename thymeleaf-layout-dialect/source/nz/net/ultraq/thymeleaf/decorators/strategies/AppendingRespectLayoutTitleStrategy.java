/**
 * A special version of the {@link AppendingStrategy} sorter that respects the
 * position of the {@code <title>} element within the layout page.
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour of the layout dialect has historically been to place
 * the {@code <title>} element at the beginning of the {@code <head>} element
 * during the decoration process; an arbitrary design decision which made
 * development of this library easier. However, this runs against the
 * expectations of developers who wished to control the order of elements, most
 * notably the position of a {@code <meta charset...>} element. This sorting
 * strategy instead keep {@code <title>}s wherever they exist within the
 * target/layout template being decorated, and then appending everything else as
 * normal.
 * <p>
 * This will become the default behaviour of the layout dialect from version 3.x
 * onwards, but was introduced in 2.4.0 to be a non-breaking change.
